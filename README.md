Visualizing Citi Bike Data Using Tableau

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to conduct a bikesharing analysis of 2019 Citibike data from New York, New York with the hopes of starting a similar bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. A potential investor may be interested in providing some seedfunding toward this venture but New York City vastly different from Des Moines. 

The first step was to figure out how the bikesharing business actually works in NY City, then create a proposal of how it may work in Des Moines. Using the data downloaded from Citibike, a series of data visualizations were created to support the upcoming proposal.

## Results
The following visualizations are results of the analysis performed on the 2019 Citibike data from New York City, New York.

Individuals who use Citibike in New York were more likely to become subscribers than pay-as-you-go customers. **1,900,359** individuals were subscribers and **443,865** were customers.

Individuals who use Citibike in New York are more likely to take shorter duration trips (between 1-23 minutes) as opposed to longer trips (between 23-60 minutes). Even fewer users check out Citibikes passed the one hour mark.

Males were much more likely to use Citibikes over females and even fewer individuals have an unknown gender. In New York, males made up **1,530,272** of Citibike users, females made up **588,431** of users, and unknowns were **225,521** of Citibike users.

For customers, individuals were more likely to use Citibike on Saturdays and Sundays as opposed to any other day. For subscribers, males and females tended to use Citibike on a daily basis (from Sunday through Saturday) with the most usage seen on Thursdays and Fridays. Individuals with an unknown gender were less likely to be subscribers and more likely to be customers.

Most trips for both males and females occurred between Mondays and Fridays at 8 AM, 5 PM - 7 PM. Wedneday evenings were the least busiest for Citibike users. While less in comparison to weekdays, weekend trips for males and females mostly occurred between the hours of 10 AM and 7 PM. Similar to *User Trips by Gender by Weekday*, those with an unknown gender mostly used Citibikes on weekends between the hours of 11 AM - 5 PM on Saturdays and 10 AM - 7 PM on Sundays.

As expected, males were much more likely to check out Citibikes as opposed to any other gender. However, men were also more likely to rent a Citibike for a shorter duration of time in comparison to females and unknown genders. Females, however, were much more likely to rent a Citibike greater than 60 minutes compared to males and "unknowns."

Based on the two visualizations below, top starting *and* ending locations in New York were located within the same areas. This could be interpreted as a majority of trips tend to happen within and around highly-populated tourist areas. Short trip durations could be attributed to the close proximities of the starting and ending locations.

## Summary

Overall, based on the results of the analysis for New York bikesharing, a few assumptions could be made about potentially implementing a bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa:

- [x] Individuals who choose to use bikesharing services generally become subscribers as opposed to pay-as-you-ride 
- [x] Males may be more likely than females to use and participate in these services 
- [x] Bikesharing is used for both commuting throughout the week and for leisure on the weekends
- [x] Expect a high number of bike rentals during heavy commute hours: between 6 AM - 10 AM and 4 PM - 7 PM.
- [x] A majority of bike hubs should be strategically placed in highly trafficked, populated areas 

An additional analysis that could support the proposal of a bikesharing service in Des Moines, Iowa, is to look more closely at the top starting and ending station names in New York City. Understanding where and why certain stations are busier than others could help make an educated guess on where in Des Moines bike hubs would make the most sense. A bar chart would make most sense for this visualization. Additionally, another supporting analysis could be to determine the birth year range for those that join as subscribers versus customers. This information could shed insight on affordability concerns, awareness barriers, or accessibility. A heatmap could be the most informative visualization for this analysis.
