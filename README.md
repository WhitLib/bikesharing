Visualizing Citi Bike Data Using Tableau

## Overview

A potential investor may be interested in providing some seedfunding toward this venture but New York City vastly different from Des Moines. 

The first step was to figure out how the bikesharing business actually works in NY City, then create a proposal of how it may work in Des Moines. Using the data downloaded from Citibike, a series of data visualizations were created to support the upcoming proposal.
